# ROSE layout 
ROSE (revised optimized and stylized extended) keyboard layout created by Manning. 

### Credit and motivation 
The implementation of this layout is based off of EPKL (EPiKaL Portable Keyboard Layout) by OEystein B "Dreymar" Gadmar [https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixPKL]. 

The ROSE Layout is a simplified version of EPKL with that was created for my personal use only. It removes a lot of features that I deem unecessary and only keeps the barebones of EPKL + some additional new features.
